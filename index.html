    My name is Josie, and this is my archive of twisty puzzle stickers :) I have been
    cubing since 2011 and started designing stickers in early 2025. I wanted to be able
    to share my stickers with others since my go-to shops (CubeSmith and Oliv√©r's Stickers)
    have closed down since I got into the hobby. If you have a local makerspace or library
    a vinyl cutter (or scrapbooking mom willing to lend you her Cricut), cutting your own
    stickers is fast and easy (and if you're cutting more than one set, it's much cheaper
    than buying sticker sheets online).
