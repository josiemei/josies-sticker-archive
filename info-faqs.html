    <ul class="faq-list">
      <li class="faq-list-question">Can I sell physical stickers that I cut with these vectors?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">Yes, with attribution. See the <a href="#StickerLicensing" class="regular-link">sticker licensing</a> section!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">Can I buy physical stickers from you?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">Not yet, but I have plans to set up an Etsy shop for these!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">How do you design your stickers?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">I use the open source vector software <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="regular-link">Inkscape</a>, along with a set of calipers to measure the pieces of the puzzles.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">What is the difference between <b>Creator Tested</b>, <b>Community Tested</b>, and <b>Untested</b>?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer"><b>Creator Tested</b> means that I myself have cut these stickers on a vinyl cutter and confirmed that the fit matches my expectations.</li>
          <li class="faq-list-answer"><b>Community Tested</b> means that one or more members of the community have cut these stickers and confirmed that they match their expectations.</li>
          <li class="faq-list-answer"><b>Untested</b> means that I have not yet cut these stickers and have not received confirmation from others that they have tested the stickers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">How can I cut these stickers?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">You can use any vinyl cutter that can take SVG files as input in its software. I use a Cricut Explore 3.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">What vinyl should I use for stickers?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">Make sure you pick a permanent vinyl--it is also worth looking online for reviews as to the durability of whichever vinyl you choose. I use the Cricut permanent vinyl for the most part, and it has worked well for my uses :)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">Can I use transfer paper for applying the stickers?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">I do not use transfer paper personally, and have not designed the stickers for use with transfer paper, so do so at your own risk. While the stickers themselves are measured for the puzzle, the spacing between them is not always accurate.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">How can I suggest stickers that you don’t already have here?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">You can leave a suggestion via the <a href="contact-me.html" class="regular-link">Contact Me</a> page. If it’s not a puzzle I own, I may ask for measurements to aid in the creation of these stickers. This is a hobby for me, so I cannot guarantee that I will have the bandwidth to make every set of stickers requested.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">How can I make my own modifications to these stickers?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">You can open the SVG in your favorite vector software (Inkscape or Illustrator are the most common, but there are others) and make edits from there. For most of my files, I have private copies of the “templates” for the puzzles, which are easier to make edits to because they don’t have the applied fillets or booleans, but they are very messy. I can provide them upon request.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-list-question">If I feel the fit of a given sticker set is wrong, where can I leave that feedback?
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li class="faq-list-answer">Go to the page for a given sticker set, and click the "Give Feedback" link at the bottom of the page. Please be as specific as possible about what you feel is wrong with the stickers, and feel free to include an image if that would be helpful for demonstrating the issue.</li>
